                <h4>Appleseeds Academy | 2020</h4>
                <p>
                    I was teaching front-end development to junior developers. The curriculum included
                    everything there is to know for a beginner, ranging from HTML tags and CSS flexbox
                    all the way to unit testing, React hooks and virtual dom. The academy was in
                    partnership with big tech companies such as Microsoft, Palo Alto Networks, Natural
                    Intelligence and Bezeq. We teached the students in their offices with some of their
                    developers by our side.

                    Worked on multiple projects for Aman team’s clients. My work included designing the
                    web application together with the project manager and developing them. I helped with
                    migration of projects from JQuery to React. Also integrated PHP backend with COBOL
                    application.

                <p>
                    I was a teacher assistant in the evenings while I worked as a fullstack developer in
                    Aman team. The curriculum was similar to Appleseeds academy, only this time I was
                    also teaching the students backend, which included Nodejs, Express and MongoDB.
                    the level was much higher too, I had to teach how to build some of the core
                    functionalities in JS from scratch.

                <p>
                    My first steps in the industry as a full-stack developer were in IBM. My role was to
                    develop features and maintain applications for a major bank, which was IBM’s long
                    term client. The team was made of about 20 COBOL developers and about 4 PHP
                    developers, which I was one of them. Most of the new features our team had to
                    develop was designed by us and a UX UI designer with a senior developer.
